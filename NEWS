2.3-2
	* Fixed formatting error in citation.
	
2.3-1
	* plot.ncvreg: Made the passing of arguments more flexible, so
	that user can pass options concerning both the plot and the lines.
	* plot.ncvreg: Changed some of the default settings with respect
	to color (hcl instead of hsv) and line width.

2.3
	* cv.ncvreg.Rd: Fixed the documentation, which no longer agreed
	with the function usage.  This was an oversight in the release of
	version 2.2.

2.2
	** cv.ncvreg: Divorced cross-validation from fitting.  From a user
	perspective, this increases flexibility, although obtaining the
	model with CV-chosen regularization parameter now requires two
	calls (to ncvreg and cv.ncvreg).  The functions, however, are
	logically separate and involve entirely separate methods.
	** plot.cv.ncvreg: Developed a plotting method specific to
	cv.ncvreg objects.
